# How It's Made
Tech used: u-center, MATLAB, Python, RTKLIB, Google Earth
Proceduces:
1.Connect the GNSS Receiver and Antenna to Laptop
2.Logging data by U-center.
3.Convert the raw data to u-box UBX format
4.Open the ubx format data on u-center and plot the graphs
5.Present the output on RTKplot and Google Earth
6.Process GNSS data with Python scripts and evaluation positioning error

# Learned
